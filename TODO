TODO:
 - remove dependency on stringr?
 - Refactor to 
   - match.modifiers: 
       fixed, perl (regex), ignore.case, exact, partial
   - search.modifiers: 
       reverse.lookup - look in values  
       any, all
       recursive (unlist)  
   - return.modifeirs: 
       key, value
       searchable (returns a searchable object), 
       recursive: first, last, second, third, nth(string,n)
   - setting modifiers:
       uniqueness
   
 - Determine if we need subclasses: 
   - searchable.atomic and searchable.recursive
     There are no classes for atomic and recursive(?)
   - searchable.vector, searchable.list, searchable.hash

- Should be able to:
  v %>% searchable %>% ignore.case   for example. 
  This could be done by changing the S4 slot modifiers to the match mofiers
